## About

PlatePal is an interactive recipe-sharing platform where culinary enthusiasts can not only showcase their own creations but also explore and review recipes from a global community. With powerful filters for dietary restrictions, meal types, and international cuisines, PlatePal ensures users can easily find the perfect dish to match their taste and lifestyle preferences, making it the ultimate destination for food lovers.

### Description and Purpose

We wanted to create a webpage where users can share recipes with each other, and provide feedback to others about the recipes theyâ€™ve tried. Additionally, this website can help people explore dishes from different cultures, or possibly reconnect with their own. 

### Inspiration

We felt inspired by the fact that there are a lot of unique people with unique tastes in this world, and the desire to connect with others across the world over something we share in common: food. Everyone needs to eat, and most enjoy doing so, and thus sharing recipes with others is a great way to connect people and learn about different cultures, try to be healthier, or learn something new!

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Typescript, TailwindCSS, MaterialUI

Backend: Node.js, Express, Railway hosting the PostgreSQL Database, Prisma

DevOps: ESLint + Prettier, Docker

## Features

### Sign Up/Log In User Authentication

Users must create an account to post recipes, and theyâ€™ll need to log in each time they visit. The platform will maintain a user database to manage accounts and authentication.

## Additional Features

Users can leave reviews on other recipes (1-5 stars with commentary). This is what will determine the highest-rated recipes.

Users can bookmark other recipes they really like so they can easily access them again

### âœ…  Filter By Ingredients
Users can find recipes that save them a trip to the grocery store by selecting only the ingredients that they have, and the webpage will only show recipes that they can make with what they have
