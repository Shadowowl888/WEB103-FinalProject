## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Due to our extensive experience in this class and Web 102, setting up the website and navigation was a breeze, and we were able to implement most of the pages this week (the exception being the edit page). However, all links present in the webpage as of today do work.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
This week was a busy week for all of us, so finding the time to balance the project with other obligations was a challenge. However, the group communicated well about expectations and division of labor. 

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?
No, we did not finish all of the tasks in the sprint board. We should prioritize getting the database and API endpoints done, so the website can actually have real data. 


### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
I would say the log-in feature is most "at risk", as it has not been started, and we need to ensure and protect user privacy. 

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
Ways to encrypt passwords.
