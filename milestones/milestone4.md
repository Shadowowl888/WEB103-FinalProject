## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to connect the frontend and the backend with ease. 


### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
We struggled with the routing to the backend, currently it is hardcoded, but we are working on a solution to fix that in the coming week.


### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

No, we were not able to work on the authentication feature this week. Our next priority will be implementing an authorization system. After that would be adding more features to the recipes, the review system, and UI improvements. 


### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I would say that the comments system is most "at-risk" as we are a little behind schedule, and we need to ensure authentication and that the user can add ingredients, and implement all of the data tables. If the comments system remains at risk, we will look for other ways to make the website interesting. 
### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
Clear expectations on grading.
