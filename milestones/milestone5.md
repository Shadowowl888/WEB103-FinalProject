## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to get the endpoints working for filtering recipes by cuisine, meal type, dietary restrictions, and ingredients working. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Due school assignments and our busy schedules, we were unable to implement one of our planned features, user authentication, and deploy our web app to railway. 

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

Getting the filter system to work was a good feeling. 

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

We've learned so much about the fundementals of backend development and how it is connected to the database and front end. 

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

We would like to learn more about advanced web development concepts, like CI/CD and setting up your own database.
